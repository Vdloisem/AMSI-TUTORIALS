The goal is to learn how to represent a specific, concrete situation (a \"snapshot\" of a system) using instances of classes from a given class diagram.\n\n---\n\n\n**Problem:**\nGiven the following class diagram for a Petri Net, model the specific state of the Petri Net shown in the image below as a UML Object Diagram.\n\n![Class diagram for a Petri Net.](images/exo6-reseau-petri.png){fig-alt=\"Class diagram for a Petri Net.\" width=\"80%\"}\n\n![The specific state of a Petri Net to be modelled.](images/exo-petri-net-problem.png){fig-alt=\"A Petri Net with four places, two transitions, and tokens.\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" title=\"Click to see the solution\"}\n\n![Object diagram solution for the Petri Net exercise.](images/exo-petri-net-solution.png){fig-alt=\"Object diagram of the Petri Net state.\"}\n\n**Correction Details:**\n\n* **Instances of `Place` and `Transition`:** The solution correctly creates four named instances of the `Place` class (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`) and two named instances of the `Transition` class (`t1`, `t2`). Each instance is given a `label` corresponding to its name in the diagram (e.g., `\"P1\"`, `\"T1\"`).\n\n* **Instances of `Arc` (Links):** The seven arcs from the problem are modelled as seven distinct, named instances of the `Arc` class (`a1` to `a7`). The `source` and `destination` links for each arc instance are correctly connected to the appropriate `Place` and `Transition` objects, modelling the directed graph structure.\n\n* **Instances of `Token` (State):** The state of the Petri Net is represented by four instances of the `Token` class (`tk1` to `tk4`).\n    * `p1` and `p4` each contain one token.\n    * `p3` contains two tokens (`tk2` and `tk3`).\n    * Each `Token` object is linked to the `Place` object that contains it via an instance of the `se situe` association.\n\n* **Instance of `PetriNet`:** The entire system is contained within a single instance of `PetriNet`, named `mon_petri`. All `Place`, `Transition`, and `Arc` objects are linked to this main object, respecting the composition relationships defined in the class diagram.\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Exercise 2: Email Service\n\n**Problem:**\nBased on the class diagram modelling a university's email service, create the object diagram that represents the specific email situation shown in the image below.\n\n![Class diagram for a university email service.](images/exo-email-class-diagram.png){fig-alt=\"Class diagram for an email service.\" width=\"80%\"}\n\n![A screenshot of an email sent by Tony Leclercq.](images/exo-email-problem.png){fig-alt=\"An email from Tony Leclercq with two attachments.\" width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" title=\"Click to see the solution\"}\n\n![Object diagram solution for the Email exercise.](images/exo-email-solution.png){fig-alt=\"Object diagram of the email situation.\"}\n\n**Correction Details:**\n\n* **Instances of `m1: Mail`:** A single instance of the `Mail` class represents the email. Its slots are filled with the corresponding data: `sujet = \"Email 1\"` and `objet = \"Hello World !\"`.\n\n* **Instances of `pj1, pj2: PieceJointe`:** The two attachments, \"AMSI.pdf\" and \"MAPLE2013.pdf\", are modelled as two distinct instances of the `PieceJointe` class. Both are linked to the `m1` mail object via the `possède` (owns) composition link.\n\n* **Instances of `c1, c2, c3, c4: Compte`:** The four email addresses involved are represented by four instances of the `Compte` (Account) class, with their `adresseMail` slots correctly filled.\n\n    * `c3` and `c4` represent the accounts of Tony Leclercq.\n    * `c1` and `c2` represent the external recipients.\n\n* **Links for Senders/Recipients:** The links correctly model the email's flow:\n\n    * The `est envoyé par` (is sent by) link connects `m1` to `c4` (Tony's sending account).\n    * The `est destiné à` (is sent to) links connect `m1` to `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` (the three recipient accounts).\n\n* **Instances of `p1, p2: Personnel`:** Two instances of `Personnel` are used to model Tony Leclercq, who is both the sender and a recipient. This might seem redundant, but it correctly represents his dual role in this specific transaction. Both instances are linked to their respective `Compte` objects (`c3` and `c4`).\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThis chapter provides practical exercises to apply the concepts of UML Object Diagrams.
